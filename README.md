# Vivian's Flowers — Pixel-Art Flower Shop
## 1. Project Overview

Vivian's Flowers is a modern full-stack e-commerce flower shop website built with a pixel-art game-inspired visual style.
The project simulates an online flower shopping platform where users can browse products, search flowers in real time, manage shopping carts, and place orders through a seamless single-page application experience.

The website combines a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database to provide a responsive and interactive shopping experience.
It also includes JWT-based authentication and role-based access control for normal users and administrators.
